I thought you said you could hang?

h2. What to buy

Tested with GripRite brand Home Depot common nails. 8D sisze 2-1/2" long. Bright finish. 

h2. How to bend

Insert a nail into the provided printed holes. Find a chonky pair of pliers and make the first bend holding the nail as close to the plastic as possible to 90 degrees.

Grab the nail again about halfway down the bent part, and while forcing the tip down, rotate the piece in the jaws up so it folds back on itself. 

You basically want the tip of the nail to go out, back, and come around again to just about the same level with the plastic. 

I found it is good to bend it haphazardly, and test by inserting it into the pegboard. If the support protrusions don't sit flush, you bent it too far back. If you can push on the outtermost supports and they have wiggle, bend it further in. 

You want it sitting flush and no play in or out. The weight of the magazines will pull it forward and down.

See bent-nail.png for an example.
